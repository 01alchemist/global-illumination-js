### Global Illumination JS Summary

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/01alchemist/global-illumination-js.png)](https://travis-ci.org/01alchemist/global-illumination-js)

I am a [Global Illumination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_illumination) renderer using [path tracing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_tracing) written in Typescript/Javascript.

Rendering algorithm is ported from [Go implementation](https://github.com/fogleman/pt) written by [Michael Fogleman](https://github.com/fogleman)

##Disclaimer: Currently it only works with Firefox Nightly since multi-threading relying on SharedArrayBuffer.  

### Features

* Supports OBJ
* Supports textures, bump maps and normal maps
* Uses k-d trees to accelerate ray intersection tests
* Supports various material properties
* Light sources with configurable attenuation
* Supports configurable depth of field
* Supports iterative rendering
* Uses all CPU cores in parallel

### TODO

Here are things that I'm planning, or at least hoping, to do.

* Shared scene
* Binary STL and ASCII STL Loader
* Subsurface scattering
* Atmosphere
* Constructive solid geometry
* Animation support?
